>*discrete-time signal* : a signal whose independent time variable is quantized so that we know only the value of the signal at discrete instants in time.

>[!Note]
If a continuous sinewave represents a physical voltage, we could sample it once every $t_s$ seconds and represent the sinewave as a sequence of discrete values.

>*LTI* : linear time-invariant
## 1.5
A linear system’s output is the sum of the outputs of its parts. Where:
$x(n)_1+x(n)_2 → y(n)_1+y(n)_2$
## 1.6
A time-invariant system is one where a time delay (or shift) in the input sequence causes an equivalent time delay in the system’s output sequence. Keeping in mind that n is just an indexing variable we use to keep track of.
## 1.7
LTI systems have a useful commutative property by which their sequential order can be rearranged with no change in their final output
